# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `:no-prompt:` per-block directive option: renders a block as plain
  script-style code (no `>>>`/`...` prompts), with output shown as
  `# → ...` comment lines instead of interleaved REPL-style text.
- `<lang>_fail_on_error` config key (e.g. `pycon_fail_on_error`): when
  true, a `runblock` whose code raises (or fails to parse) fails the
  Sphinx build with a `RunBlockError` pointing at the `.rst` file:line,
  instead of only embedding the `!! [RUNBLOCK-ERROR]` marker in the
  rendered output. Defaults to `False`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-29

Cleanup release -- 1.0.0 was published from a commit that still had
`rename-plan.md` (an internal one-time planning doc) tracked at repo
root, and before `test/` was renamed to `examples/` (it read as a typo
next to `tests/`). PyPI releases are immutable, so this couldn't be
fixed in place. No functional/behavioural changes from 1.0.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-29

First release under the new name. Renamed from `sphinx-autorun` (that
PyPI name belongs to an unrelated, still-maintained project by Hugo
Osvaldo Barrera). Hard fork -- heritage documented in the docs.

- `src/` layout, hatchling build backend
- real pytest suite, ruff-clean
- fixed a runfirst-duplication bug, dead console config, a stray debug
  print, and bare `>>>`/`...` prompt lines not being treated as blank
  lines (broke every for/try/if example needing a blank terminator)
- working CI (test/lint matrix + OIDC trusted-publish release workflow)
- real Sphinx docs site (quickstart, full `conf.py` reference, fork
  history)
